# Pediatric Emergency Care Web Application - System Design

## Implementation approach

For the Pediatric Emergency Care Web Application, we will implement a Progressive Web App (PWA) approach to ensure offline capability, mobile-first design, and cross-device compatibility. Here's our implementation strategy:

### Key Technology Decisions

1. **Frontend Framework**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.

2. **UI Library**: Material-UI with customized theming for responsive, accessible components that work well in high-stress situations.

3. **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application-wide state management with Redux Persist for local storage support.

4. **Offline Capability**: 
   - Service Workers for caching static resources
   - IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) for client-side storage of critical data
   - Workbox for advanced offline strategies

5. **Backend**: 
   - Node.js with Express for API development
   - MongoDB for database (with Mongoose ODM)

6. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token storage

7. **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component testing

8. **Deployment**: 
   - Docker containers for consistent deployment
   - HTTPS for security
   - CDN for static assets

### Difficult Points & Solutions

1. **Offline Data Synchronization**:
   - Implement an offline-first architecture using IndexedDB
   - Create a synchronization queue for changes made offline
   - Handle conflict resolution when reconnected (latest change wins)

2. **Data Accuracy & Critical Updates**:
   - Version control for medical algorithms and dosing information
   - Background sync for critical updates when connectivity is available
   - Clear visual indicators for outdated information

3. **Performance in Emergency Situations**:
   - Aggressive pre-caching of critical resources
   - Minimal runtime dependencies
   - Optimized render cycles and code splitting
   - Memory-efficient data structures

4. **Cross-Browser & Device Compatibility**:
   - Progressive enhancement approach
   - Feature detection with graceful fallbacks
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

5. **Security for Medical Data**:
   - Encryption for sensitive data storage
   - Sanitization of all inputs
   - Proper CORS and CSP configurations

## Data structures and interfaces

The application will be organized around the following core data structures and interfaces:

### Core Domain Models

1. **User**: Represents healthcare providers using the system
2. **Patient**: Temporary representation of pediatric patients (not persisted after session)
3. **Algorithm**: PALS and other medical algorithms with steps and decision trees
4. **Medication**: Medication details including dosing formulas
5. **Equipment**: Medical equipment with sizing information
6. **PhysiologicalParameter**: Age-specific vital signs and parameters
7. **Checklist**: Customizable emergency procedure checklists
8. **EmergencyContact**: Hospital and critical contact information
9. **CPRSession**: Tracking for active CPR sessions

## Program call flow

The application follows these core flows:

1. **Initial Load & Setup**:
   - Load application shell and critical resources
   - Initialize service workers and offline capabilities
   - Authenticate user (if applicable)
   - Synchronize data if connectivity available

2. **Patient Assessment Flow**:
   - Input patient age/weight/length
   - Calculate relevant parameters
   - Present appropriate algorithms and tools

3. **Algorithm Navigation Flow**:
   - Step-by-step progression through PALS algorithms
   - Decision points with branching logic
   - Dynamic updates based on interventions

4. **Medication Calculation Flow**:
   - Select medication from formulary
   - Input patient parameters
   - Calculate and display dosing information
   - Record administration (optional)

5. **CPR Assistance Flow**:
   - Start CPR session with timer
   - Provide audio/visual cues for compressions
   - Track interventions and reassessment points

6. **Offline Synchronization Flow**:
   - Queue changes made while offline
   - Attempt synchronization when connectivity detected
   - Resolve conflicts according to business rules

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Integration with ePCR platforms**: The requirements mention integration with electronic Patient Care Report platforms. This would require specific API details for those systems, which aren't specified. The architecture allows for this integration, but specific connector implementations would need to be developed once API specifications are available.

2. **Agency-specific customizations**: The requirements mention customization for agency-specific protocols. We'll need to define a configuration system that allows for these customizations without requiring code changes.

3. **User authentication requirements**: The level of user authentication required isn't clearly specified. The architecture includes JWT-based authentication, but specific requirements around user roles, permissions, and authentication methods may need refinement.

4. **Regulatory compliance**: Medical applications may require compliance with regulations like HIPAA. Additional security measures may be needed depending on the deployment context and data handling requirements.
